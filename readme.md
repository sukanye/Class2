# Homework Due Sunday, January 31:
## [Fill out this survey](https://surveyplanet.com/56a97f0e4bd6c096645444c4) (9 questions)
…or don't, you have the option of being anonymous so I don't know who did or didn't. I do find it really helpful and it impacts what we do next week. For example this was a question and answer from last week's survey.

> *Q: Is there anything in particular you want clarified?*

> I found the loops to be a bit complex- I am not sure if there are better examples where you can see this happen. Maybe it would be helpful to actually do an in class example/creation on our own so any issues can be solved in class.

## Pull request (PR) to this repository
- A sketch that has several objects created from a single function that are generated by calling a function (like we made in class). Each one of these should be interactive in some way.

Experiment in different directions. Don't just make a grid like in class, it can even just be one or two objects. Remember you can still use the functions that you became familiar with in the first assignments. Bonus points if you make more than one of these or use the `new` keyword.

Keep in mind that you'll get to show off this work to the class.

Resources:
Remember you can go though the [commits from class](https://github.com/ArtG2260SpringTuesday2016/Class2/commits/master) as an example.

## In your private repository
- Sketch an idea for a game then write a little bit about it in your readme.md.
- Make a folder named class2 with a p5 sketch:
  - Create an object that describes you.
    - You can either use a function or an object.
  - Create another object that describes your favorite food.
    - use `var foodName = {}` where `foodName` is the name of the food.
  - Assign your favorite food to be a property of the object that describes you.
  - Print out an attribute from your object describing you using either `console.log` or p5's `text()` function.
- Create an array and then use a loop to print out or modify every value
- Write in the readme file the things you had trouble with (if any).

### Bonus points:
Make a github.io page include a link to it in your PR to this repository.

P5 sketches start with an `index.html` file. If that is at the top level (root) of your repository it should be what shows up. If you've done any coding with `html` or `css` feel free to play with it but it's out of scope of this class so you will not be graded on it.

  - You want to use a "project site" https://pages.github.com/
  - help: https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/
  - Help on just github pages https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiOgz3nKpgk
  - Help on all of github. You can skip the command line stuff because we're using github desktop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds

## If you're having issues with this assignment…
Open an issue here https://github.com/ArtG2260SpringTuesday2016/Class2/issues @mention anyone you think might be able to help. You can still send me a message on slack.
